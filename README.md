# Coursera_Capstone

This is a coursera capstone project in applied data science course to predict car accident severity.

Reducing traffic accidents is an important public safety challenge around the world. Accident prediction is important for optimizing public transportation, enabling safer routes, and cost-effectively improving the transportation infrastructure, all in order to make the roads safer. 

The goal of accident prediction is usually to provide a measure of the risk of accidents at different points in time and space. The occurrence of an accident is the label used to train the model, and the proposed model can be used to identify where and when the risk of accident is significantly higher than average in order to take actions to reduce that risk.
